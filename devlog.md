# order.life — Devlog

Dated log of autonomous work-loop progress. Newest first.

## 2026-06-29

- **iCal Phase 2 — DONE.** New dedicated subscribe landing page at
  `/calendar/ical/` (`templates/calendar/ical.html`), generated per-language in
  `build.py` after the gaian-era page. Lists all three feeds (`current.ics`,
  `current_ja.ics`, `gaian-holidays-extended.ics`) with `webcal://` subscribe +
  `https://` download links and step-by-step Google / Apple / Outlook
  instructions. Linked from the calendar overview (quick-link card + "all
  subscribe options" pointer). Verified by running `build.py` (exit 0, no render
  errors): root + `/ja/` + `/es/` pages produced, all feed links present, `.ics`
  files coexist with `index.html`. `site/` is gitignored — CI rebuilds.
- **Autonomous work loop established.** Created `queue.md` from the `todo.md`
  backlog (organized into ACTIVE / BLOCKED-needs-Emma / GATED / pinned tail) and
  started the three session-local crons: work-loop (`0,30`), auto-flush (`15,45`),
  status-report (`:50`). User asked the work-loop to fire on the hour and half-hour.
- **Stale queue hygiene (earlier this session):** verified iCal Phase 1 + the
  universal day-description (Phase 3) were already shipped in `build.py`; pruned the
  stale "needs fixing" entries from `todo.md` (commits `aaf47749a` → life `c969446`
  → hub `c04fab3`). Post-power-interruption check: no stranded work, all repos clean.
